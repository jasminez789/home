		<h3 id="subtitle3" class="sub">Step 3: Drying</h3>
		<p id="process3" class="para">To make sure that the beans will not mould during transportation, they must be dried. Usually they are dried by being spread out under the sun.
		<br><a class="goto" href="#top">Go to top</a>
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="subtitle4" class="sub">Step 4: Transporting</h3>
		<p id="process4" class="para">Cocoa beans grow in hot climates like South and Central America but are most often made in cool climates like Europe and North America. After cocoa beans are dried, they are usually shipped off to chocolate makers or chocolate making companies.

		<h3 id="subtitle5" class="sub">Step 5: Roasting</h3>
		<p id="process5" class="para">The specific ways of roasting are different to each chocolate maker. Some have roasting systems that are able to rotate the beans and roast all beans as evenly as possible.

		</p>
		
		<h3 id="subtitle6" class="sub">Step 6: Cracking &amp; Winnowing</h3>
		<p id="process6" class="para">After the beans are roasted they have a thin shell around them that must be removed. The beans are cracked open and the shell is removed. The process is called winnowing and leaves behind what is known as cocoa nibs.

		<h3 id="subtitle7" class="sub">Step 7: Grinding &amp; Conching</h3>
		<p id="process7" class="para">The cocoa nibs are ground until they become a paste. This paste is called cocoa liquor &lpar;not as in that it contains alcohol&rpar; that contains the chocolate part called cocoa solids as well as the natural fat from the bean called cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is removed from the cocoa mass with a hydraulic press.
		<br>The cocoa mass is transferred into a conch where it stays for anywhere from a few hours to a few days &lpar;depending on the chocolate maker&rpar; where the chemical structure and particle size of chocolate are affected. Other flavours are added to the chocolate at this step.
